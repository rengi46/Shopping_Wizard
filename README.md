## 3.1 Form requirements
Below are the general requirements that the form should have:
Each step page will contain a ‚Äúnext‚Äù and a ‚Äúclear form‚Äù button.
The ‚Äúnext‚Äù button will link to the next step.
The information of the form will be saved in memory, the main purpose of this pill is to learn to work with HTML, CSS and JS together with the part of validation done in Javascript.
The ‚Äúreset‚Äù button will reset all the input values in the current step introduced by the user to the default ones
Step 4 will contain a ‚Äúfinish‚Äù button instead ‚Äúnext‚Äù that will link to the ‚Äúthank you‚Äù page
In this page there will be a link to start the form again.
All the JS validation messages will be displayed in the screen below the respective input in a paragraph with the custom message.
This element must be loaded in the HTML using Javascript.
You will need to apply custom styles to the inputs that have not passed the validation to apply some error styling, such as the letter or container being shown in red
For every minute that the user remains in the purchase process (step 1, step2, step 3 and step 4), a message must be shown on the screen that must be hidden 5 seconds after it appears.
The purchase process will have a time limit of 5 minutes (start in step 1), if it is not completed in this period of time (the process is completed by reaching the thank you page), a message should appear on the screen indicating that the maximum time allowed for the purchase process has been exceeded and will automatically redirect you to the product screen in 5 seconds (the first screen)
When you reach the Thank You page you will show all the values that are specified in the documentation (shipping, purchase time, ...) and then you will have to reset all the information that you have stored in this process (time, price, ‚Ä¶)

##  4. Requirements
You will have to implement the entire application using a single HTML file
All the processes must be carried out without reloading the page
You cannot use cookies, localStorage or any similar technologies
You cannot use third-party libraries
## 5.Extras üíØ
Once you have implemented the main features of the application you should implement the following extra requirements (that are not specified in any particular order) as a challenge for yourself and your team. However, you can also consider them during the development of the pill if you would like to implement any of them from the beginning, such as the design requirements or the browser compatibility.
It is easier to develop a feature from the beginning than to modify it later.
5.1 Browser compatibility
You should check that everything is compatible with other current browsers, and, as an extra step.
5.2 Input validation
All the input validation should be done after users have entered a value, this means that you should only validate the value in the input fields after a value has been entered and not before users interact with the inputs.
The validation should be done when the input field loses focus, that is, users type a value, they change focus to another element, then the field validation runs.
After a validation message is entered and users focus the input element to adjust the value, the validation message and any error styles should be removed until the user has entered a new value and the focus is lost from the input field as before.
5.3 The design of the application should be different and not have a wireframe look similar to the wireframes we provide
5.4 Remove event listeners
All the event listeners that were attached to the elements in the other containers such as modals should be removed to avoid memory leaks.
5.5 Responsive design
All the screens and steps should be responsive using flexbox so that they can be used in any device size.
5.6 Accessibility
You should use semantic HTML elements for all the app such as buttons and HTML5 sectioning elements (main, section, nav, etc)

## 6. Deliverables
To evaluate the project you will need the following deliverables:
### Project repository with:

A presentation in Google Slides explaining:
Explain what lessons you‚Äôve learned during this project
What problems have you encountered when developing this project?
Explain how you changed roles to develop the project for each phase (screen)
